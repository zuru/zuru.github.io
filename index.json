These span both hardware and software topics like the selection of sensors, the balancing of processing power and costs, the design of the system, and even tripod mounts to ensure the portability of the setup. The presented Volumetric Capture system has been remotely and on-site deployed in various places around the globe as one of its central design goals apart from affordability was its portability and usability. The tutorial will also describe how these two important components for the aforementioned aspects have been addressed, namely the spatial (i.e. StructureNet) and temporal alignment of the sensors, in ways that are sensor-agnostic – allowing for hybrid-sensor deployments – and scalable, offering flexible capturing scenarios. However, as expected, these design choices come at a cost, and the limitations of this approach will also be presented and discussed. Finally, the tutorial will present the work that has been supported and enabled by this low-cost volumetric capture system, showcasing potential uses. More importantly, taking into account the ongoing data-driven revolution, such systems can be used for easily collecting volumetric datasets, with an example being HUMAN4D.\n  ","date":1620059400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620059400,"objectID":"ff1a54120e10224e52537e780ae8c86c","permalink":"/talk/volumetric-video-tutorial/","publishdate":"2021-05-03T16:30:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/volumetric-video-tutorial/","section":"event","summary":"Low-cost volumetric video with consumer grade sensors.","tags":["Volumetric"],"title":"Volumetric Video Tutorial","type":"event"},{"authors":["Nikolaos Zioulis","Federico Alvarez","Dimitrios Zarpalas","Petros Daras"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to copy/download publication metadata (*.bib).

AR has the potential to make the communication processes highly effective and provide a better experience for the customer. Current AR authoring solutions are quite complex and require manually creating scenes or rely on objects prepared with even more complex applications (e.g. CAD). ATLANTIS will fill this gap in authoring AR experiences by creating a faithful textured geometric (3D) representation from images of the real scene and identifying and segmenting objects in the scene and associating them with the 3D representation.\nThe ATLANTIS authoring tool will enable the fusion of 3D CG elements with real scenes in a guided manner using artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate more productive and effective content creation. This allows automatic alignment of inserted objects and automated layout generation, enabling the user to interact with different options without the need to manually author each of them. In addition, ATLANTIS will innovate beyond traditional AR authoring by complementing the capacity with Diminished Reality (DR) authoring capabilities, enabling the removal and replacement of real objects in the scene allowing to visualise also heavy changes to an environment. The innovations of ATLANTIS will be integrated in an existing solution for interior design and retailing, and validated with professionals and customers.\n","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"7bddc20e24f82d2678fca957ae523034","permalink":"/project/atlantis/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/atlantis/","section":"project","summary":"Authoring tool for indoor augmented and diminished reality experiences.","tags":["AI","360","XR"],"title":"ATLANTIS","type":"project"},{"authors":["Vladimiros Sterzentsenko","Alexandros Doumanoglou","Spyridon Thermos","Nikolaos Zioulis","Dimitrios Zarpalas","Petros Daras"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to copy/download publication metadata (*.bib).
